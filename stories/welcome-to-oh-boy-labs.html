      <div class="text-start">
        <p>OH BOY! Labs was an idea that I had been thinking about for many years. I had spent 25+ years in a corporate environment, but I really wanted to create apps and games for myself. I tried creating apps in the past by working nights and weekends. But this proved to have too slow of a development pace. 🐌 I knew, if I wanted to make larger more full featured apps, I was going to have to make this my full-time job. In 2022, I made this idea a reality with OH BOY! Labs. 👏</p>
        
        <p>I wanted to create fun, colorful and engaging apps and games for iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, Apple Watch and the Mac. Over the years, I had collected many ideas 💡 for apps and games. Often the best app is one that satisfies your own needs. If I wanted an app, then there's a good chance that others would want them also.</p>

        <div class="m-4 text-center fs-2">
          <div class="d-inline-flex p-2 bg-secondary bg-gradient text-light">"I was going to have to make this my full-time job."</div>
        </div>

        <p>I will talk about this in more detail in later stories, but I have to mention Swift and SwiftUI. These are technologies that Apple created over the last several years. I can honestly say without these new tools, I would not have the capacity to create and update so many apps. They are game changers for app development. 💯</p>

        <p>Here are a few of the many apps and games I have available in the Apple App Store.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/wdwbingo/">WDW Bingo</a> - 🔍 A Disney World scavenger hunt game.</li>
          <li><a href="/learningdecks/">Learning Decks</a> - 👩‍🏫 A learning app to help your toddler learn the alphabet, numbers, time, space, animals and much more.</li>
          <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/interstate-bingo/id1271211778" target="_blank">Interstate Bingo</a> - 🚗 A fun game to play while traveling in your car with friends and family.</li>
          <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-most-unique-game/id1189629526" target="_blank">The Most Unique Game</a> - 📺 This AppleTV, iPhone and iPad game gives the player a category. Then it's up to you to create the most unique list of items in each category.</li>
        </ul>
